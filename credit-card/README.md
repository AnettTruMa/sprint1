### Validation of credit card number

1. Create a function "isValidCard"
2. Ask to the user for her/his credit card number, by using the "prompt ()"
   method.
3. Check that the array is not empty, if it is the user can not continue unless
   he/she enters an array  is not empty.
4. Built a "for" loop from the first element in the array to the last one by
   steps of one, within this execute the  following instructions.
5. The first step is to invert the array, it is possible with the
   "reverse()"
6. Select the even elements of the array and multiply them by a factor of two.
7. Implement the condition expression which helps us to distinguish
   between a number larger or equal than 10 or not. If the number is larger than
   10, add both digits to get only one digit less than 10, and
   replace the old value by this new one.
8. Now, add both even and odd elements of the array.
7. The result is divided by a factor of 10, if the residue is equal to 0, then
   the credit card number is valid, if not then ask for the credit card
   number one more time.
